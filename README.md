Terrorism and nihilism become exponentaly grater threats with advancements in technology and knowledge. Comunities must constantly scale down in order to survive, becouse they become a threat to themselves.

At the end they might transform into cells of around 3 indivuduals, similar to the alien flying soucer. Individuals get cloned when they die and get similar education the his predecesor. They also have access to all the predecesorss work/ideas/documentation, so death or suicide are not anymore that terrible. 

After some number of generations the cell itself is cloned, meaning all the technology, data and individuals get duplicated. In this time of splitting instead of one, two clones are created and when the last individual is doubly cloned the cells go their separate ways.

Of coures the question is, what meaningful stuff can this individuals do? They of course have acces to all the entertainment/knowledge/philosophy/art and tools that help with the creation and evaluation of this fields, but is this enough for a meaningful existance? Can sexuality still exist?

To get a bit pathetic, are they not but a gods in a vaccum? And don't gods alway get frustrated and start wrecking havoc out of their boredom and fustrations? Of course good old selection might "help" here, by selecting the more stable cells.

But where would that lead? If we assume virualy unlimited resources, doesent that lead to overpopulation by preety uniform and boring cells, basicaly an end of the history. Isn't
there something depressing in thought, that there might not exist some special matter like
cristals on the dune or some big project/frontier that would drive us forward. Wouldn't such a situation totaly devalue existance, or to put it more psychoanaliticaly, could death drive survive such a scenario.

Could repetition help? For instance, wouldn't this overpupulation inspire hope larger comunities, that would potentialy provide some new insights before diverging again into smaller cells. To put it more "scientificaly", can ther exist a dynamic "ecosystem" where every cell is avare of this ecosistem's properties and can acordingly change and addapt to the situation. For example how would an island of grass, rabbits and foxes function, where each entity could freely change at any time.

It seems like eveybody would become grass, because as soon as somebody would change in a rabbit, the patch of grass that he is standing on would change into fox and try to eat it. The rabbit would then change back to grass forcing the fox to find a new place. In case all the places would be taken it would have to change into rabbit, what would force the same patch to change into fox and so on. So util all island would be covered in grass, only grass
would exist, but then we would get this sharing of the patch of land among multiple indiviudals.

This brings us to Borghes shor story The Library of the Babel, where the whole universe is one huge library, a web of connected hexagonal rooms with nothing but balconies of shelves of books (what about toilets?:). The question is, is it posible to overpopulate universe?
At least to the degree, that the cells are too close to each other for comfort so that they
start something similar to the tranformatios that happened on the island. Of course, one could quickly
