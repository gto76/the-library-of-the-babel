The Library of the Babel
========================

With advancements in technology and knowledge, terrorism and nihilism become exponentially grater threats. Communities must constantly scale down in order to survive, because they become a threat to themselves.

At the end they might transform into cells of around three individuals, similar to the alien flying saucer. Individuals get cloned when they die and get similar education the his predecessor. They also have access to all the predecessors work/ideas/documentation, so death or suicide are not anymore that terrible. 

After some number of generations the cell itself is cloned, meaning all the technology, data and individuals get duplicated. In this time of splitting instead of one, two clones are created and when the last individual is doubly cloned the cells go their separate ways.

Of course the question is, what meaningful stuff can this individuals do? They of course have access to all the entertainment/knowledge/philosophy/art and tools that help with the creation and evaluation of this fields, but is this enough for a meaningful existence? Can sexuality still exist?

To get a bit pathetic, are they not but gods in a vacuum? And don't gods alway get frustrated and start wrecking havoc out of their boredom and frustrations? Of course good old selection might "help" here, by selecting the more stable cells.

But where would that lead? If we assume virtually unlimited resources, doesn't that lead to overpopulation by pretty uniform and boring cells, basically an end of the history. Isn't there something depressing in thought, that there might not exist some special matter like the spice on the planet Dune or some big project/frontier that would drive us forward. Wouldn't such a situation totally devalue existence, or to put it more psychoanalytically, could death drive survive such a scenario.

Could repetition help? For instance, wouldn't this overpopulation inspire hope larger communities, that would potentially provide some new insights before diverging again into smaller cells. To put it more "scientifically", can there exist a dynamic "ecosystem" where every entity is aware of this ecosystem's properties and can accordingly change and adapt to the situation. For example how would an island of grass, rabbits and foxes function, where each entity could freely change at any time.

It seems like everybody would become grass, because as soon as somebody would change in a rabbit, the patch of grass that he is standing on would change into fox and try to eat it. The rabbit would then change back to grass forcing the fox to find a new place. In case all the places would be taken it would have to change into rabbit, what would force the same patch to change into fox and so on. So until all island would be covered in grass, only grass would exist, but then we would get this sharing of the patch of land among multiple individuals.

This brings us to Borges' short story The Library of the Babel, where the whole universe is one huge library, a web of connected hexagonal rooms with nothing but balconies of shelves of books (what about toilets?:). The question is, is it possible to overpopulate universe? At least to the degree, that the cells are too close to each other for comfort so that they start something similar to the transformations that happened on the island. Of course, one could reject such a view as to reductionist, looking at this effectively infinite web of gods as a mere colony of bacteria, but still.

Other interesting part of the story is that shelves contain every possible book of 300 pages (or less?). Even though that would effectively mean that most individuals would never in their lives see a coherent work, there might be something significant to this. Namely that this fact would have been known to every inhabitant, meaning a frame of the universe/existence would have been
universally shared. A kind of transcendental dream that turned out to be a nightmare, precisely because, not only it erases a possibility of an authentic action*, but also it makes this
castration totally transparent, unhidable.


* In the story there are some mentions of the movements, that were destroying some books, but were of course totally impotent, because there would always remain millions of books that would differ in one character.
